Creating custom middleware in ASP.NET Core is a great way to handle cross-cutting concerns in your web application. Middleware is a piece of code that can handle requests and responses in the ASP.NET Core request pipeline.


Middleware Class (RequestResponseLoggingMiddleware.cs):

Logs the request path.
Logs the response status code.
Extension Method (RequestResponseLoggingMiddlewareExtensions.cs):

Provides a convenient method to add the middleware to the request pipeline.
Sample Controller (HelloWorldController.cs):

A simple controller that handles GET requests and returns "Hello, World!".
Configuration (Program.cs):

Adds the middleware to the request pipeline using app.UseRequestResponseLogging().
Configures the HTTP request pipeline to use controllers and Swagger for API documentation.

Request and Response Logging:

Monitoring and Debugging: By logging the request paths and response status codes, you can monitor the traffic to your application and debug issues. If an error occurs, the logs can help you understand what requests were made and what responses were returned.
Auditing: Keeping a record of requests and responses can be important for auditing purposes, especially in applications where tracking user actions is necessary for compliance reasons.

ure! Let's extend your ASP.NET Core application by adding an additional custom middleware for exception handling. This middleware will catch exceptions thrown by other middleware or the controller, log the exception details, and return a standardized error response.

Summary
Exception Handling Middleware (ExceptionHandlingMiddleware.cs):

Catches exceptions thrown by downstream middleware or controllers.
Logs the exception details.
Returns a standardized JSON error response.
Extension Method for Exception Handling Middleware (ExceptionHandlingMiddlewareExtensions.cs):

Provides a convenient method to add the exception handling middleware to the request pipeline.
Request/Response Logging Middleware (RequestResponseLoggingMiddleware.cs and RequestResponseLoggingMiddlewareExtensions.cs):

Logs the request path and response status code.
Configuration (Program.cs):

Adds the exception handling middleware to the request pipeline using app.UseExceptionHandling().
Adds the request/response logging middleware to the request pipeline using app.UseRequestResponseLogging().
Configures the HTTP request pipeline to use controllers and Swagger for API documentation.
Sample Controller (HelloWorldController.cs):

A simple controller that throws an exception to test the exception handling middleware.
When you run the application and navigate to /helloworld, the exception handling middleware will catch the thrown exception, log it, and return a JSON error response. Additionally, the request/response logging middleware will log the request path and response status code.
