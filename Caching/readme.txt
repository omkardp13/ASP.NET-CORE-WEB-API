Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API is a technique to store frequently accessed data temporarily in memory, which can improve the performance and scalability of your application. Here's why caching is important and useful:

Improves Performance: By storing the results of expensive data retrieval operations (like database queries or API calls) in memory, you can reduce the time required to fetch data on subsequent requests.

Reduces Server Load: Cached data reduces the need for repeated data processing or database hits, lowering the overall load on your server and backend systems.

Enhances User Experience: Faster response times lead to a better user experience as users receive data more quickly.

Cost Savings: Reduced load on databases and external services can translate to cost savings, especially if you're paying for database transactions or external API usage.

How Caching Works in ASP.NET Core Web API
In-Memory Caching: This is the simplest form of caching where data is stored in the server's memory. It's suitable for small to moderate amounts of data that do not require high availability or distributed access.

Distributed Caching: For larger applications, a distributed cache (like Redis or SQL Server) can be used. This allows caching across multiple servers, providing high availability and scalability.
